#This file contains some tips and tricks 

#when you have a belongs_to in model, you can get an attribute from the table that belongs_to with 'delegate', EJ.
	class Profile < ApplicationRecord
		belongs_to :user #user is another model

		delegate :email, to: :user #its easier profile.email than this, profile.user.email
	end

#to do between
	Model.where(created_at: 10.days.ago .. Time.now)

#to specify a relation between models
	rails generate model comment user:belongs_to body:text

#to use Logger and not puts to show debug info, this will show it in your enviroment .log 
	Rails.logger.info "DEBUG:: THIS IS A LOGGER MESSAGE #{HERE YOU CAN INTERPOLATE YOUR CODE}"

	tails -f log/development.log | grep DEBUG #this command is entered in console

#compare size, this operator return 1, -1 or 0
	x <=> y
	# 1 when left value is bigger
	# -1 when right value is bigger
	# 0 when both values are equals

#
	%w{a b} #this return ["a","b"]
	%i{a b} #this return [ :a, :b]
